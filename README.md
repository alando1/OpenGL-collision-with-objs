# OpenGL-glut-world-maps-with-objs
program demonstrates real world time based physics for first person movement with gravity.  Objects are parsed and loaded into array pointers that are given to openGL functions to be drawn by the graphics card as efficient as possible.  Terrain maps are currently still drawn with primitives, need to be converted to .obj files.   NOTE: download freeglut 3.0 and gcc-6.2.0 or newer.  also download SDL2 and properly include library and .dll files in relative path.
